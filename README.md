An aspiring Data Analyst
------------------------

I’m a passionate data enthusiast with a keen eye for patterns and insights. My journey into the world of data began with a fascination for numbers and a desire to unravel hidden stories within them. Whether it’s crunching numbers, visualising trends, or building predictive models, I thrive on turning raw data into actionable knowledge. I’m excited to share my journey and projects with the GitHub community. 

🌱 Background: I have a diverse background in Information Technology (I.T.). Over the course of my career, I’ve held various roles, starting as a Service Desk Analyst. In this role, I promptly answered phone calls to assist users in resolving their issues, aiming for swift solutions. Subsequently, I transitioned to the IMAC Team (Installation, Moves, and Changes). Here, my primary responsibility was to configure newly ordered equipment for individual users, ensuring seamless installation and proper functioning of all software and operations. Additionally, I collaborated with the Technical Specialist Team during Outside Broadcasts (OB’s), such as events like The Chelsea Flower Show and The Wimbledon Tennis Championship. My tasks involved setting up networks for the BBC and providing on-location support to staff. I then transitioned to become an IT Analyst. My main duties included providing face-to-face support for all IT equipment, patching network points, configuring VOIP phones (Voice Over Internet Protocol), weekly backups and NIC (Network Internet Card) configuration. I also covered the late shift (from 12 pm to 8 pm) on a rotational basis. Furthermore, I assisted users at the Tech Bar, where they could seek help without logging a formal call—simply visiting the desk with their laptops or mobile devices. Driven by curiosity, I delved into data analysis, discovering its remarkable ability to unveil hidden patterns. This newfound passion quickly captured my heart. 📊 Data Enthusiast: I’m fascinated by data—whether it’s a spreadsheet, a CSV file, or a complex database. I believe that every dataset has a story waiting to be told, and I’m here to decode it. 

🔍 Learning Journey: I’m currently honing my skills through a 12 week Data Technician Bootcamp, consisting of tutorials, and hands-on projects. Data visualisation, statistical analysis, and machine learning are my playgrounds. What You’ll Find Here: 

🚀 Projects: I’ll be sharing various data analysis projects I’ve completed. From exploratory data analysis (EDA) to predictive modeling, I’m eager to showcase my growth.
